          <p class="bestFont">In this theme park, everybody is equal, but some people are far more equal than others.</p>
          <p class="bestFont"> - Peasants can get in for free and access the field. There, they can view, but not pet, the animals at the petting zoo. They can also shovel dirt for free.</p>
          <p class="bestFont"> - Citizens pay a fee, and can also access the town, forest, wetlands, and some of the castle. The majority of the rides are in these areas. </p>
          <p class="bestFont"> - Knights pay a larger fee, and also have access to the royal guard area and the entirety of the castle, as well as other benefits. This is for elite guests.
          <p class="bestFont"> - The position of King is auctioned off every day, and only one person can become King per day. The King rules over Feudal World and can tell other guests what to do. Because of liability issues, they don't actually have to do anything. </p>
          <p class="bestFont"> Use WASD to move around and the mouse to look around. Have fun! </p>
          <p class="bestFont"> All 3D models were made by us, the character movement was programmed by us, and the project was made with Unity. The song is "Overture" from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which is an excellent movie. </p>
